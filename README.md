Main route is "/" route where user can log in as an admin or as a client, or sign up as a client.
In a project, there are 2 roles for now(admin and client).
Client credentials to log in for example:

# Testing
All tests are in test\projekat file

# Problems I ran into
One of biggest problems I ran into was problem with POST method, because I couldn't find way to read data from request body. Also, it took time to make app's context, I couldn't find way to separate app's route. Learning about middlewares and handlers was a hard job. It was a little bit boring making HTML elements, too.
